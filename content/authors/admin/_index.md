** About me**

I am a researcher at CNRS working at the Laboratory of
Plasma Physics (LPP), in Palaiseau, France. My field of
research is space plasma physics, and in particular the
phenomenon of Magnetic Reconnection, which I study with
numerical simulations and spacecraft observations. I enjoy
sharing what I do and learn, that is what motivated me to
make this website, that I’ll try to keep updated as much as
possible. You will find here informations related to my work,
including my research (topics, papers, talks, projects, etc.).
